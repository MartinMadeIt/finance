## If you think that App can be usefull - wait some time, when final version of App will be released.
### Major things to fix/add :
#### Client side:
* responsiveness 
* more charts (like comparing spending in category between two date intervals)
* smoothness in some actions (for now - creating spending requires to refresh the page to display new . Register site should redirect to home page after register)
#### Code side:
* code refactor
* fix some logic
* comments - to increase code readability
* increase performance and accessibility
